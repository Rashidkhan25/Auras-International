        <h2>Your Journey With Us</h2>
        <p>
          At Auras International, we recognise the importance of clarity and
          trust when collaborating across borders. That’s why we’ve outlined our
          streamlined process in five thoughtfully crafted stages, ensuring a
          seamless experience from design to delivery.

          <h3>Design & Outline Creation</h3>
          <em>Every embroidery begins with a vision.</em>
          <p>
            Each piece starts with a hand-drawn outline — the foundational
            tracing that defines placement, proportion, and form. Every design
            is crafted with clarity, creativity, and purpose. This becomes the
            soul of the embroidery, guiding every subsequent stitch.

          <h3>Artwork Development & Material Mapping</h3>
          <em>Where technical brilliance meets artistic instinct.</em>
          <p>
            Our artists convert the outline into detailed artwork, mapping
            thread directions, motifs, and embellishment placements. Beads,
            sequins, and textures are thoughtfully chosen to elevate the
            narrative of the piece.

          <h3>Hand Embroidery by Master Artisans</h3>
          <em>Crafted by tradition, perfected by hand.</em>
          <p>
            Our artisans bring artwork to life, one meticulous stitch at a time.
            From aari and zardozi to French knots and fine threadwork, every
            technique is executed with precision and care. Time slows down here
            — because true luxury is never rushed.

          <h3>Quality Control & Finishing</h3>
          <em>Every detail matters.</em>
          <p>
            Every piece is inspected for stitch quality, embellishment security,
            and finishing consistency. Edges are refined, threads sealed, and
            surfaces pressed — ensuring the embroidery is flawless and
            production-ready.

          <em>Secure. Neat. Ready for delivery.</em>
          <p>
            Finished pieces are pressed, covered in tissue or soft paper, and
            securely packed to ensure they reach safely to clients and ateliers.
            Each shipment is documented and handled with care — closing the loop
            of a process built on skill, commitment, and pride in the craft.
